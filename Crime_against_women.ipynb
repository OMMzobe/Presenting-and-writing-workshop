    "## 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Violence against women in India refers to physical or sexual violence committed against a woman, typically by a man. \r\n",
    "Common forms of violence against women in India include acts such as domestic abuse, sexual assault, and murder. There are several forms of violence against women, mured , female infanticide, sexual criem , acid throwing, perpetuaioni. \n",
    "\n",
    "The persistence of violence against women in India is deeply rooted in entrenched systems of sexism and patriarchy that permeate Indian culture. The cycle begins in early childhood, where young girls face unequal access to education compared to their male counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As women progress into adulthood, the social climate continues to reinforce inequality, contributing to the prevalence of violence against them. Within the context of marriage, many women in India come to perceive violence as a routine aspect of their married lives. Those subjected to gender-based violence often face victim-shaming, being told that their safety is solely their responsibility and that any harm they endure is their own fault. Social and cultural beliefs, such as the importance of family honor, exert immense pressure on women to remain complicit in the face of abuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.1 Problem Statment\n",
    "emDespite legal and social advancements, violence against women in India remains a significant issue, deeply rooted in entrenched systems of sexism and patriarchy. Between 2001 and 2021, various forms of violence, including domestic abuse, sexual assault, acid attacks, and murder, have continued to impact women across the country. These forms of violence are perpetuated by cultural and social norms that promote gender inequality, beginning with unequal access to education in childhood and continuing into adulthood, where many women view violence as a normalized aspect of marriage. Furthermore, societal victim-shaming and the pressure to uphold family honor further inhibit women from seeking justice or support. Addressing this systemic issue requires a comprehensive analysis of the trends, causes, and consequences of crimes against women in India over the two-decade period, with the goal of informing effective strategies for prevention and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Aim\n",
    "2 The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of crimes against women in India from 2001 to 2021, with a focus on identifying trends, underlying causes, and societal factors contributing to gender-based violence .By examining data over two decades, the project seeks to provide insights into the prevalence and forms of violence, explore the impact of cultural and social norms, and highlight the gaps in policy and protection mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Objecives\n",
    "teData Analysis: To collect and analyze crime data related to violence against women in India between 2001 and 2021, identifying key trends, regional disparities, and the most prevalent forms of violence\n",
    "- yExamine Societal and Cultural Factors: To explore the role of entrenched societal and cultural norms, such as sexism, patriarchy, and victim-shaming, in perpetuating violence against wome.\n",
    "- sImpact Assessment: To assess the impact of gender-based violence on women's physical, mental, and social well-being, as well as its broader implications for society\n",
    "- eRecommendations: To propose actionable recommendations and interventions for government bodies, NGOs, and community organizations, with the goal of reducing violence against women and fostering gender equality."
